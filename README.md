# UChicago Incident Page Scraper
This repository houses a scraping engine for the [UCPD's Incident Report webpage](https://incidentreports.uchicago.edu/). The data is stored on
[Google Cloud Platform's Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore) and ran using [Heroku's Dyno](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-types) functionality.

## Primary Application Functions
1. Scrape the UCPD Incident Report webpage every weekday morning, pulling all incidents from the latest reported incident date in the Google Datastore to the current day.
2. Upload all stored UCPD incidents to the _Chicago Maroon_'s Google Drive every Saturday morning.
